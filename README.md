# AtrialGeneral

1. The repository contains the core codes of "AtrialGeneral: Domain Generalization for Left Atrial Segmentation of Multi-Center LGE MRIs".
The code includes four baseline models (U-Net, U-Net++, DeepLab v3+ and MAnet) and three model generalization schemes.
The schemes include histogram matching (HM), mutual information based disentangled representation, and random style transfer.

2. The dataset employed in this work is from:
ISBI 2012: Left Atrium Fibrosis and Scar Segmentation Challenge (http://atriaseg2018.cardiacatlas.org/) and
MICCAI 2018: Atrial Segmentation Challenge (http://www.cardiacatlas.org/challenges/left-atrium-fibrosis-and-scar-segmentation-challenge/)
